SLK: Saber Liquid Kernel
===

A custom Samsung Galaxy Nexus Kernel based on Cyanogemod for Liquid Unofficial ROM (Saber Liquid ROM) and compiled by Sabermod toolchain 4.9.1 

I think (in the future) to make 3 versions of SLK:

1) SLK-BASIC: simply and very basic custom Cyanogenmod based kernel thought for Liquid Unofficial ROM but compatible with F2FS and ext4 filesystems. It is basic for avoid any kind of problem and thought to be entered (boot.img) as standard into Liquid unofficial ROMS based (like Saber Liquid ROM). [Standards CPU frequencies and No cherry-picks and undervolts by It !] 

2) SLK-STD (STANDARD): SLK BASIC based but with adding of cherry-picks (the essential). Target: stability and battery friendly. [Standards CPU frequencies and No undervolts by It !] 

3) SLK-EXT (EXTENDED): SLK STD based but with adding of cherry-picks (experimental also). Target: more speed and smoothness, so It could be more unpredictable, unstable and probably little battery friendly. [No standards CPU frequencies and Undervolts are possible, etc... ; here... everything will be possible !]
